# Phrag

DB Schema Data to GraphQL

Phrag creates instantly-operational GraphQL routes from DB schema data.

#### Features:

* Creates a GraphQL-powered [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) route for different routers such as [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) and [bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi).

* Supports nested resource structures for `one-to-one`, `one-to-many` and `many-to-many` relationships on top of `root` entities.

* DB schema data can be retrieved from a running DB or specified with a config map selectively.

* Data loader (query batching) wired up to avoid N+1 problem even for nested queries.

* [Filtering](#resource-filtering), [sorting](#resource-sorting) and [pagination](#resource-pagination) come out of the box.

* GraphQL IDE (like GraphiQL) connectable.

#### Notes:

* This project is currently in POC/brush-up stage in a real project usage. It hasn't been published to Clojars yet.

### Schema Data to Nested Resource Structures

### Usage

##### reitit

```clojure
;; Read schema data from DB (as data for Integrant)
{:phrag.core/reitit-graphql-route {:db (ig/ref :my-db/connection)}
 ::app {:routes (ig/ref :phrag.core/reitit-graphql-route)}}

;; Provide schema data (direct function call)
(def routes (phrag.core/make-reitit-graphql-route {:tables [{:name "..."}]}))
```

##### bidi

```clojure
;; Read schema data from DB (as data for Integrant)
{:phrag.core/bidi-graphql-route {:db (ig/ref :my-db/connection)}
 ::app {:routes (ig/ref :phrag.core/reitit-graphql-route)}}

;; Provide schema data (direct function call)
(def routes (phrag.core/make-bidi-graphql-route {:tables [{:name "..."}]}))
```

##### Notes:

When reading schema data from DB connection, Phrag leverages naming patterns of tables/columns to identify relationships:

> Table names can be specified in the [config map](#phrag-config) for other naming patterns. (In this case, Phrag will not attempt retrieving schema data from DB.)

1. `Root` or `N-to-N` relationship?

	A table name without `_` would be classified as `Root`, and a table name pattern of `resourcea_resourceb` (like `members_groups`) is assumed for `N-to-N` tables. 

2. `1-to-1`/`1-to-N` relationship?

	If a table is not `N-to-N` and contains a column ending with `_id`, `1-to-1`/`1-to-N` relationship is identified per column.

### Phrag Config

Though configurable parameters vary by router types, Phrag doesn't require many config values in general. Some key concepts & list of parameters are as below:

#### Config Parameters

| Key                     | Description                                                                                       | Default Value      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `:db`                   | Database connection object.                                                                       |                    |
| `:table-name-plural`    | `true` if tables uses plural naming like `users` instead of `user`.                               | `true`             |
| `:resource-path-plural` | `true` if plural is desired for URL paths like `/users` instead of `/user`.                       | `true`             |
| `:tables`               | DB schema including list of table definitions. Plz check [Schema Data](#schema-data) for details. | Created from `:db` |

#### Schema Data

Schema data is used to specify custom table schema to construct GraphQL without querying a DB. It is specified with a list of tables under `:tables` key in the config map.

```edn
{:tables [
   {:relation-types [:root :one-n]
    :name "users"
    :columns [{:name "id"
       	      :type "text"
               :notnull 0
               :dflt_value nil}
              {:name "image_id"
               :type "int"
               :notnull 1
               :dflt_value 1}
	           ;; ... more columns
	           ]
    :belongs-to ["image"]
    :pre-save-signal #ig/ref :my-project/user-pre-save-fn
    :post-save-signal #ig/ref :my-project/user-post-save-fn}
    ;; ... more tables
    ]}
```

##### Table Data Details:

| Key              	 | Description                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:name`              	 | Table name.                                                                                                       |
| `:columns`             | List of columns. A column can contain `:name`, `:type`, `:notnull` and `:dflt_value` parameters.                  |
| `:relation-types`      | List of table relation types. `:root`, `:one-n` and `:n-n` are supported.                                         |
| `:belongs-to`          | List of columns related to `id` of other tables. (`:table-name-plural` will format them accordingly.)             |
| `:pre-save-signal`     | A function to be triggered at handler before accessing DB. (It will be triggered with request as a parameter.)    |
| `:post-save-signal`    | A function to be triggered at handler after accessing DB. (It will be triggered with result data as a parameter.) |

### Resource Filtering

Format of `filter: {[column]: {operator: [operator], value: [value]}` is used in query arguments for filtering.

##### Example:

`{users (filter: {id: {operator: lt, value: 100} id: {operator: ne, value: 1}})}` (`users` where `id` is less than `100` `AND` `id` is not equal to `1`)

> * Supported operators are `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`/`lte`, `gt`, and `ge`/`gte`.
> * Multiple filters are applied with `AND` operator.

### Resource Sorting

Format of `sort: {[column]: [asc or desc]}` is used in query arguments for sorting.

##### Example:

`sort: {id: asc}` (sort by `id` column in ascending order)

### Resource Pagination

Formats of `limit: [count]` and `offset: [count]` are used in query arguments for pagination. 

##### Example

`(filter: {id: {operator: gt value: 20}} limit: 25)` (20 items after/greater than `id`:`20`).

>* `limit` and `offset` can be used independently.
>* Using `offset` can return different results when new entries are created while items are sorted by newest first. So using `limit` with `id` filter or `created_at` filter is often considered more consistent.

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Then load the development environment.

```clojure
user=> (dev)
:loaded
```

Run `go` to prep and initiate the system.

```clojure
dev=> (go)
:duct.server.http.jetty/starting-server {:port 3000}
:initiated
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```clojure
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:resumed
```

### Testing

Testing is fastest through the REPL, as you avoid environment startup
time.

```clojure
dev=> (test)
...
```

But you can also run tests through Leiningen.

```sh
lein test
```
