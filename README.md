# Phrag

**GraphQL from an RDBMS Connection**

Phrag implements its [approach](docs/mechanism.md) to creating GraphQL from an RDBMS connection for instant and flexible data accesses with customization options.

## Overview

- **Instantly Operational:** Phrag creates a GraphQL simply from a RDBMS connection, retrieving schema data of tables, columns, primary keys and foreign keys. It can be run as a Clojure project or [stand-alone releases](#stand-alone-releases).

- **CRUD Features:** tables and/or views become queryable as root objects including nested objects of [n-ary relationships](docs/mechanism.md#relationships) with [aggregation](docs/sql_feature.md#aggregation), [filter](docs/sql_feature.md#filtering), [sorting](docs/sql_feature.md#sorting) and [pagination](docs/sql_feature.md#pagination) supported. [Mutations](docs/mechanism.md#mutations) (`create`, `update` and `delete`) are also created per table.

- **Performance in Mind:** Phrag's query resolver translates a nested object query into a single SQL query, leveraging correlated subqueries and JSON functions. [Load tests](docs/performance.md) have also been performed to verify it scales linear with resources without obvious bottlenecks.

- **Customization:** Phrag comes with an [interceptor capability](#interceptor-signals) to customize behaviors of GraphQL. Custom functions can be configured before & after database accesses per an operation type & table. It can make a GraphQL service more practical with access controls, event firing and more.

- **Practicality Tested:** Phrag was developed side by side with a [POC project](#poc-project) to verify its concept and validate the practicality.

> **Demo:**

> [Here](https://phrag-standalone-lr6v6b2tza-uc.a.run.app/graphiql/index.html) is a live demo of Phrag's GraphQL connecting to a DB of this [schema](https://github.com/ykskb/phrag-standalone/blob/main/db/meetup_project.sql). You can see and try what Phrag creates merely from a database provided.

## Requirements

Phrag only requires an RDBMS to create its GraphQL. Here's a quick view of database constructs that are important for Phrag. Detailed mechanism is explained [here](docs/mechanism.md).

- **Primary keys:** Phrag uses primary keys as identifiers of GraphQL mutations. Composite primary key is supported.

- **Foreign keys:** Phrag translates foreign keys to nested properties in GraphQL query objects.

- **Indices on foreign key columns:** Phrag queries a database by both origin and destination columns of foreign keys for nested objects. It should be noted that creating a foreign key does not always index those columns (especially origin column).

> **Notes:**
>
> - Supported databases are SQLite and PostgreSQL.
>
> - If PostgreSQL is used, Phrag queries usage tables such as `key_column_usage` and `constraint_column_usage` to retrieve PK / FK info, therefore a database user provided to Phrag needs to be identical to the one that created those keys.
>
> - Not all database column types are mapped to Phrag's GraphQL fields yet. Any help would be appreciated through issues and PRs.

## Usage

### Clojure Project

Phrag's GraphQL can be created with `phrag.core/schema` function and invoked through `phrag.core/exec` function:

```clojure
(let [config {:db (hikari/make-datasource my-spec)}
      schema (phrag/schema config)]
  (phrag/exec config schema query vars req))
```

There is also a support for creating Phrag's GraphQL as a route for [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) or [Bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi):

```clojure
;; Add a route (path & handler) into a ring router:
(ring/router (phrag.route/reitit {:db my-datasource})

;; Also callable as an Integrant config map key
{:phrag.route/reitit {:db (ig/ref :my/datasource)}}
```

> **Notes:**
>
> Database (`:db`) is the only required parameter in `config`, but there are many more configurable options. Please refer to [configuration doc](docs/config.md) for details.

### Stand-alone Releases

There is a stand-alone version of Phrag which is runnable as a Docker container or Java process with a single command. It's suitable if Phrag's GraphQL is desired without any custom logic or if one wants to play around with it. [Here](https://github.com/ykskb/phrag-standalone) is the repository of those artifacts for more details.

Try it out as a Docker container with a [self-contained DB](https://github.com/ykskb/phrag-standalone/blob/main/db/meetup_project.sql):

```sh
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 ykskb/phrag-standalone:latest
# visit http://localhost:3000/graphiql/index.html
```

Run as a Docker container with your SQLite:

```sh
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 \
-v /host/db/dir:/database \ # mount a directory of your database
-e JDBC_URL=jdbc:sqlite:/database/db.sqlite \ # specify DB URL
ykskb/phrag-standalone:latest
# visit http://localhost:3000/graphiql/index.html
```

### POC Project:

- [SNS](https://github.com/ykskb/situated-sns-backend): a situated project of Twitter mock to verify Phrag's concept and practicality. It has authentication, access control and custom logics through Phrag's interceptors, leveraging Phrag's GraphQL for queries with many nests and conditions.
